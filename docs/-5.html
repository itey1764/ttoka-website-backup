including this fireplace, which has literally had a fire in it ten thousand times.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Travis laughed. This guy was great. Travis couldn’t decide if the guy actually bought what he was selling, or if he just had an angle. Surely, he just had an angle. Right? The thing was, he was super sarcastic, and that was funny. He used a lot of old photographs to make his points, and a lot of those seemingly had merit. Chicago after the fire looked like it had been air raided, rather than burned.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">My Lunch Break</em> was a booming channel on Youtube. He explored the idea that our society actually began around 1776 after some cataclysm. He posited that the World Fairs were nefarious events intended to help rewrite history and populate the United States, as well as to destroy architectural evidence of the previous society in the form of “old world buildings” which we no longer make today. This guy believed that our history was written by AI, and that everything we’ve been taught is a lie, all in order to create and spread an economic system. Because Tartaria. Or something like that.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Travis consumed a lot of media, though. Books, video documentaries, and lectures, mostly, on a diverse range of topics. He’d grown up during a time when you could only know what someone told you or what you found in a book. That was it. As a kid, he’d learned everything from a book or another person, either of which could have been unreliable. If he’d wanted to know how to fix a flat tire, he’d asked someone, and either the tire got fixed or it didn’t. If it did, he trusted what he learned. If it was historical, people from his time just took it at face value that it was a fact. Hey, it’s in a book, and experts agree. Because they read that same book.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Travis also consumed a lot of true crime. A <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">lot</em> of true crime. It had seemed the next logical step from the fictional mysteries he’d always enjoyed. There was nothing better than a good mystery for Travis. From Poe’s Dupin to Preston and Child’s Pendergast, Travis had read them all, he was pretty sure. Their villains had always fascinated Travis. Villains in general, really. Villains, without exception, always saw the world a different way. That alone didn’t make them villains, though. Lots of people don’t agree with the commonly held worldviews. From Lucifer to Osama bin Laden, villains were the people who also had the balls to do something about it. Every story he’d ever read was always crafted so that the villain lost in the end, and Travis knew why.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Well, the villains weren’t always people, technically. Witness Poe’s <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">The Murders in the Rue Morgue</em>. Interestingly, the “villain” there had been a chimpanzee, our closest living relative. We share 99% of our DNA with them. We are 99% chimpanzee. Chimpanzees are 99% human. Think about that for a moment. No, seriously. Do it.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Travis had always felt like something just wasn’t right. Was he really meant to spend his life as a cog in the economic machine so he could live in a big expensive house with air conditioning and zoom around in a metal box with wheels? Is that what he was? Is that what we, as humans, should naturally be doing? There wasn’t anything natural about that to Travis. The native Americans weren’t doing that. The Aztec weren’t doing that. The Maya weren’t doing that. The Inca weren’t doing that. 200,000 years of human history weren’t doing that.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>You know who does that? Travis knew. White people. White people do that. White people put on clothes to hide their humanity so they can focus on “progress”, wealth, and power. &nbsp;“Study the history of western ‘civilization’ and tell me I’m wrong,” thought Travis. The act of ‘civilizing’ peoples is what occurred during Westward Expansion, referred to as "Manifest Destiny" by whites of the time. Those who wouldn’t conform were killed.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Oxford defines civilization as “the stage of human social and cultural development and organization that is considered most advanced.” Most advanced? Riiiiiiiight. Just because it’s different, doesn’t mean it’s “advanced”. It doesn’t mean it’s a step in the right direction or even a good direction. It could be an aberration in the evolutionary process that nature would quickly cull. Calling it “most advanced” is editorializing it. Travis had been a journalist. He knew that only people with an agenda editorialized. Can anything that leads to pollution of the world which sustains us and the ability to destroy all human life on earth via weapons of mass destruction really be “progress” or “advancement”? Travis didn’t think so.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>We all do what we do today without even stopping to think about it, because we were taught to do it. Like our parents were taught to do it. Like their parents were taught to do it. And so on. Why? Because. That’s why. That never sat well with Travis.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Travis wasn’t interested in being “civilized” anymore just so someone else could make a buck and remain comfortable. Travis wasn’t interested in a fucking job. Travis just wanted a cave or a rock overhang somewhere where he could build a fire and raise a garden, but all the “civilized” people “owned” everything. To achieve an archaic standard of living, Travis was expected to be civilized until he could afford to be archaic. This is how they keep people in their system. Do it long enough, and you’ll get used to it. You become trained. You become comfortable. You become soft.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Go to work, okay? That’s a good boy. Here’s a plastic Voltron toy. See? You like that, don’t you? Here, stare at this screen. That’s Tony Soprano! Isn’t this nice? You can be comfortable and have these “things”, just keep being an obedient and submissive slave to the grind until you die, okay? Don’t ever be human, okay? That’s a good boy.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Travis knew that these “advanced” people used their religion to create these obedient and submissive slaves, and he knew why. Man may not fear another man, but he’ll certainly fear an all powerful being he cannot perceive, if you can just get him to believe such an entity exists. Then, even stronger men who would otherwise oppose you would comply. Willingly. Eagerly. But that doesn’t change what the man is. He’s still a human being with natural, human desires that get labeled sinful, repressing who and what he really is in order to maintain the status quo. “Don’t be human! Your humanity is bad!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.” -Paul “Pay your taxes, and slaves, be obedient to your masters.” -Also Paul. Convenient commands for the ruling elite, are they not?</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>The dissonance within him was nearing a fever pitch. His natural animal instincts warred against his brainwashed mind. “Be good and keep going to work or you won’t have air conditioning!” THIS ISN’T NATURAL “Your natural instincts are not acceptable in a civilized society.” FUCK CIVILIZATION</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Was it any wonder that Travis struggled with his mental health? Would there even be a struggle if not for the “civilized” society creating it in order to point it out and keep him marginalized? Travis had studied a lot about mental health in an effort to understand himself, mostly Cluster B personality disorders and traits. Travis remembered being diagnosed with the dark triad. He had felt <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">vindicated</em>. His super villain resume was complete. People like Travis became CEO’s, preachers, politicians, and serial killers. It’s all the same, really. Travis could spot people like him from a mile away.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Everything had clicked for Travis when he happened upon the radio show where Adam Lanza of Sandy Hook infamy called in to talk about the famous case of a chimpanzee who had been raised “civilized” to live like a human. The chimpanzee lived in a house, watched TV, wore clothes, had a job, ate meals with his human family, everything. He also became obese, addicted to Xanax, eventually ripped someone’s face off, and had to be executed by his more “civilized” human relatives. Sound familiar?</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Now, why did this happen? Travis knew. This happened because the chimpanzee had not evolved to live like that. That wasn’t what he was. He’d been brainwashed into thinking he was something that he intrinsically knew he wasn’t. Like you. Like me. <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">Like US</em>. Eventually, he couldn’t take it anymore.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Travis wanted to burn it all down and piss on the ashes. At this point, for that to happen, it would take another worldwide cataclysm like the mass extinction event that took out the dinosaurs and 75% of all life on this planet. Fortunately, this was absolutely guaranteed to happen again. 99% of Travis just hoped “progress” and “advancement” didn’t destroy 100% of his species first.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>The remaining 1% had the balls to do something about it.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div><div data-ux="GridCell" class="x-el x-el-div c1-1 c1-2 c1-3p c1-3t c1-3u c1-7l c1-2e c1-3r c1-7m c1-3s c1-7n c1-9e c1-20 c1-b c1-c c1-7p c1-7q c1-7r c1-7s c1-7t c1-7u c1-d c1-3z c1-40 c1-9f c1-9g c1-e c1-f c1-g"><div data-ux="Block" class="x-el x-el-div c1-1 c1-2 c1-20 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g"><span data-ux="Element" class="x-el x-el-span c1-1 c1-2 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g"><picture data-lazyimg="true" class="x-el x-el-picture c1-1 c1-2 c1-4 c1-5r c1-20 c1-9h c1-17 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g"><img data-ux="Image" src="../img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/57e13050-9471-4bff-be88-677a9d1e6e02/Travis_chimpanzee.jpg/%253A/cr=t%253A0%25,l%253A0%25,w%253A100%25,h%253A100%25/rs=w%253A400,cg%253Atrue" data-aid="CONTENT_IMAGE1_RENDERED" class="x-el x-el-img c1-1 c1-2 c1-4 c1-2e c1-3g c1-3h c1-z c1-6f c1-4r c1-9i c1-1r c1-9j c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-2p c1-e c1-f c1-g"/></picture></span></div><figcaption data-ux="FigCaption" data-aid="CONTENT_MEDIA_CAPTION_RENDERED" data-typography="DetailsAlpha" class="x-el c1-1 c1-2 c1-1f c1-1g c1-5o c1-z c1-6l c1-8a c1-9k c1-9l c1-9m c1-22 c1-23 c1-b c1-9n c1-9o c1-2l c1-9p c1-9q c1-9r c1-9s c1-9t x-rt"><p style="margin:0"><span><a class="x-el x-el-a c1-1c c1-1d c1-9d c1-1f c1-1g c1-2d c1-1h c1-7a c1-b c1-9u c1-1o c1-9v c1-9w" class="x-el x-el-a c1-1c c1-1d c1-9d c1-1f c1-1g c1-2d c1-1h c1-7a c1-b c1-9u c1-1o c1-9v c1-9w" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Veidt#:~:text=Adrian%20Alexander%20Veidt%2C%20also%20known,Watchmen%2C%20published%20by%20DC%20Comics." rel="noopener" target="_blank">?</a></span></p></figcaption></div></div></div></section>  </div></div></div><div id="f00f9c59-9c00-47a8-86cb-6403ab2a2eeb" class="widget widget-content widget-content-content-6"><div data-ux="Widget" role="region" id="f00f9c59-9c00-47a8-86cb-6403ab2a2eeb" class="x-el x-el-div x-el c1-1 c1-2 c1-73 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g c1-1 c1-2 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g"><div> <section data-ux="Section" class="x-el x-el-section c1-1 c1-2 c1-73 c1-h c1-i c1-b c1-c c1-l c1-m c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g"><div data-ux="SectionContainer" class="x-el x-el-div c1-1 c1-2 c1-3g c1-3h c1-16 c1-14 c1-2e c1-b c1-c c1-6h c1-d c1-6i c1-74 c1-75 c1-e c1-6j c1-f c1-6k c1-g"><h2 role="heading" aria-level="2" data-ux="SectionHeading" data-aid="CONTENT_SECTION_TITLE_RENDERED" data-typography="HeadingBeta" class="x-el x-el-h2 c1-45 c1-2 c1-1f c1-1g c1-76 c1-12 c1-10 c1-z c1-77 c1-20 c1-24 c1-6v c1-78 c1-2l c1-6w c1-79 c1-6y c1-6z c1-70"><span data-ux="Element" class="">With a Little Help from My Friends</span></h2><div data-ux="Grid" class="x-el x-el-div c1-1 c1-2 c1-y c1-3p c1-3q c1-7e c1-z c1-7f c1-11 c1-7g c1-5k c1-21 c1-b c1-c c1-7h c1-7i c1-7j c1-7k c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g"><div data-ux="GridCell" class="x-el x-el-div c1-1 c1-2 c1-3p c1-3t c1-3u c1-7l c1-2e c1-3r c1-7m c1-3s c1-7n c1-7o c1-b c1-c c1-7p c1-7q c1-7r c1-7s c1-7t c1-7u c1-d c1-7v c1-7w c1-7x c1-e c1-f c1-g"><div data-ux="ContentBasic" class="x-el x-el-div x-el c1-1 c1-2 c1-y c1-61 c1-4 c1-7y c1-7z c1-5k c1-80 c1-81 c1-b c1-c c1-82 c1-83 c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g c1-1 c1-2 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g"><h4 role="heading" aria-level="4" data-ux="ContentHeading" data-aid="CONTENT_MEDIA_HEADLINE1_RENDERED" data-typography="HeadingDelta" class="x-el x-el-h4 c1-45 c1-2 c1-1f c1-1g c1-84 c1-12 c1-10 c1-z c1-11 c1-b c1-78 c1-85 c1-2l c1-86 c1-87 c1-88 c1-89">The Sentinels</h4><div data-ux="ContentText" alignment="left" data-aid="CONTENT_MEDIA_DESCRIPTION1_RENDERED" data-typography="BodyAlpha" class="x-el c1-1 c1-2 c1-1f c1-1g c1-5o c1-z c1-11 c1-8a c1-8b c1-8c c1-8d c1-8e c1-8f c1-8g c1-8h c1-8i c1-8j c1-8k c1-8l c1-8m c1-8n c1-8o c1-8p c1-8q c1-8r c1-8s c1-8t c1-8u c1-8v c1-8w c1-8x c1-8y c1-8z c1-90 c1-91 c1-92 c1-93 c1-94 c1-95 c1-96 c1-97 c1-3t c1-b c1-78 c1-c c1-2l c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g x-rt"><p style="margin:0"><span>Clinton Anderson closed his bible, carefully marking his spot and stuffed it into his backpack. Yawning, he surveyed his surroundings carefully. This was turning out to be a great place, just like his eccentric friend had said it would be. He had been skeptical at first. People were somewhat nearby. He could hear them, occasionally. But, as promised, no one ever came here. Well, almost no one.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>He had to hurry if he was to make it to the soup kitchen before it closed at dusk. People there were kind to veterans like him who were down on their luck, even if they stayed down on their luck. His first time there, they’d given him a bible and he’d found God. Clint had struggled with mental illness since his time in the service. PTSD was a bitch, and early-onset dementia was setting in. Sure, he drank a lot. Every chance he got. He was on a first name basis with the local liquor store owner and their employees.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Clint had been homeless for well over a decade. After being discharged from service, he’d stayed on Oahu as a dive instructor, living his dream. It wasn’t long before his coping mechanism of drinking took over, and his wife left. Not long after that, he’d had to close his business. Not long after that, he’d lost his vehicle. Then his home and possessions. He’d ended up back on the mainland with nothing and no one. The VA was no help at all. Marines never leave anyone behind, but Clint sure felt left behind. That is, until, somehow, after all these years, God had finally sent him a prophet. Skayt, of all people.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>BLOOD MAKES THE GRASS GROW KILL KILL KILL</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Clint grinned, lost in the past for a moment. They had been close friends back when they both enthusiastically Screamed such cadences every morning during PT. Clint had liked to drink, even then, but somehow it had been more manageable while he was young. Time catches up with all men, eventually.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>He had been completely dumbfounded to find Skayt walking the streets that day. Skayt said he’d found Clint by searching the internet. God worked in mysterious ways. Clint hadn’t owned a phone since he lost his home. A phone served no purpose for people like him. Phones were for people who still had something to lose. Skayt had bought him a membership at the local YMCA so he could shower whenever he wanted and said that if Clint wanted to try and get back on his feet, he would help. Clint had wanted no part of that. Skayt had smiled softly at this.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Skayt had taken him out to eat, bought him clothes, and then they’d shared a fifth of Knob Creek, reminiscing about their time together in the Corps.

Why?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Skayt put his hand on Clint’s shoulder, looking him in the eye as he answered:</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“God told me to find you, Clint. He knew you had certain skills and the backbone to handle His business,” Skayt explained. “Clint, you know The Almighty uses the least among us to carry out His will, right?” Clint nodded as if this were obvious. “God sent me to you to give you an aim. A purpose in His great plan.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“A name? What could I possibly have to offer someone like you or The Almighty?” Clint had replied. “But sure, whatever you need, Skayt. Anything. Name it.” He took another drink.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Clint, God showed me a place that He thinks you will like. A beautiful home just for you. It certainly beats the crowded sidewalks and park benches,” he’d said. Clint was curious.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“A place?” he’d asked.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“A place. A place you’ll have all to yourself for the most part,” Skayt said.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“What’s the catch?” Clint knew there had to be a catch.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“I- I mean- <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">God</em>,” Skayt amended, ”is asking you only to guard it. With your life.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Clint had stared at Skayt. “With my life?” Skayt nodded, deadly serious. “What for?”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Come see,” Skayt said, waving for Clint to follow. “You’re going to love it.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Clint indeed did love the place.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Do you like it here?” Skayt asked.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“I do. I hope I never have to leave,” Clint said. Skayt slowly grinned at this response.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Then you needn’t ever leave, Clint,” Skayt said. “Unless…” Skayt's face fell then, suddenly appearing troubled.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Clint became anxious. “Unless what, Skayt?”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Well, Clint, there are some people who might try to visit you here, and you can’t allow that. They’ll only bring more people with them next time,” Skayt said. “They’ll report you to try and take away what God has given you.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“I can’t keep people from coming here, Skayt! That’s impossible. How am I supposed to stop them?” Clint asked.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Skayt had chuckled at this. “Clint, this isn’t about keeping them out. <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">It’s about keeping them in.</em> As long as no one leaves, there’s no one to report your presence or tell others about this place. They’re <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">enemies</em>, Clint. Enemies of <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">God</em>. You remember how we were trained to deal with enemies, don’t you?”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Clints eyes had narrowed then. Enemies. He hated enemies. “They don’t like God?”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Skayt shook his head, pulling out an old USMC standard-issue KA-BAR with red flecks on the blade. Skayt studied it in a distantly reflective sort of way as he spoke.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“And they don’t like you either, Clint. They’re greedy, evil people. The love of money is the root of all evil, Clint. God says so. You know that, right? These people already have more than they need, but they still want more. They have homes -unlike you, cars -unlike you, property -unlike you, $2,000 phones -unlike you, money in the bank -unlike you, a refrigerator full of food -unlike you,” Clint was getting angry now, “and if you let them leave, they’ll report you and take away even what little you have because they think you don’t have a right to be here. You, who served God and country to the point of damaging your mind.” Now Clint was really pissed.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Skayt made hard eye contact with him then.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">“They’re the people who walk right by you every day as if you aren’t there, Clint, with their Rolexes and Gucci handbags, ignoring your pleas and the audible rumble of your empty stomach,” </em>Skayt said. <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">“They’re the assholes yelling at you to get a job every day. They think you deserve to live like this, without dignity. But God disagrees and wants them punished for their sins.</em> That’s where you come in, Clint.” Skayt offered him the weapon.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Clint seethed. Staring Skayt straight in the eye, he accepted the KA-BAR and stowed it in his belt at the small of his back. It felt familiar. As if he were always destined to have it. “Are they dangerous?”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Skayt laughed, clapping Clint on the shoulder good-naturedly. “Nah, Clint. They aren’t like us. They’ll be easy marks, and besides, God will empower you in His service to carry out the important purpose He has given you. If you can do this for God, He has commanded me make sure you always have membership at the Y, and I am to make sure you always get anything you need from the soup kitchen. That’s my role in His plan to bless you. All you have to do is defend your new God-given home,” he’d said. “Do we have an accord, my brother?”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Enraged, Clint stared into Skayt’s eyes, hate twisting his features. “Damn straight we do,” he intoned, “by God.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Pointing out a specific spot under a tree a few yards away, Skayt said, “Just stack’em here with this one.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Skayt hugged him then. “I love you, brother. Don’t forget. I’m counting on you. God is counting on you. <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">You are His Sentinel</em>. May your eyes never close. Semper Fi, Devil Dog,” Skayt said.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Semper Fi, Skayt…God bless,” he’d replied, overwhelmed, as Skayt turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Skayt had been true to his word. Clint was sure Skayt had been a messenger from God, and Clint always remembered his old friend in his prayers. Clint had always been able to count on Skayt. One year after this meeting, he had gone to the Y to shower, and his membership had been renewed. The soup kitchen always had what he needed, even when the requests weren’t of the usual sort. Skayt and The Good Lord deserved his loyalty. Loyalty was all that mattered in life. SEMPER FIDELIS. Always faithful. That meant something to him. And to Skayt.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Two evil, greedy bastards had ventured into his territory since that meeting. He’d done the Lord’s good work to make sure they stayed there with him. Skayt had been right about him being good at this. They’d never seen it coming. Someday, when his wretched life was through, Clint would have a mansion in heaven for his faithful service. He’d also enlisted some faithful friends to help him watch the perimeter without letting them know that he lived inside. The soup kitchen had provided basic outdoor walkie talkies when he asked for them. His friends didn’t have anything else to do, anyway, so Clint had given them an aim. A purpose. It made them feel useful, important, even; a feeling people like him didn’t often experience.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Somewhere, thousands of miles away from Clint, Skayt closed a similar deal in a similar fashion with another fellow Marine in a similar situation, handing him a Buck 120. And a mask.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>God worked in mysterious ways.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div><div data-ux="GridCell" class="x-el x-el-div

companions find yourselves in a cavern filled with glittering riches. In the center of the room is a rock outcropping. Lounging leisurely upon it sits a beautiful angel with bronze skin and shoulder-length flaxen hair. He is girded for war with a golden metal breastplate, vambraces, and shin guards. His sword leans against one thigh, his right hand resting upon its hilt. His wings are gloriously unfurled behind him, as if he might take flight at any moment despite his attitude of repose. A man and woman wearing only visages of torment are chained to the rock upon which he sits. Treasures of gold and jewels are heaped here and there and all along the walls, but the angel has your full attention.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Ah, true seekers have arrived! It has been a while. I do hope your journey has been to your liking,” he says playfully in a melodiously masculine voice, an amused look upon his face. “Please, join me.

"They do that to themselves. Now, as is always the case, you have sought me, not I you. Here I am.

Haunted houses, Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, etc., are all a deception designed to profit off of and maintain the ignorance of the uninitiated, and I can’t support that. It’s amoral, in my view.

Life has adult themes. Truth has adult themes. We ignore them at our own peril. The search for truth is rarely comfortable or pleasant in my experience. In fact, it’s been a very hard thing. If you take it seriously, your worldview will, most likely, shatter, leaving you questioning everything you’ve ever been taught. If this happens, congratulations, you have found the starting line for this marathon, and it’s a race worth running. Most are born, content themselves with whatever ignorance was pushed onto them as children, pass that ignorance on to their children, then die. I think that’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard, and that was me, prior to 2015. Sometimes the questions are hard ones to answer, and we have to engage our brain rather than burying our head in the sand. Sometimes, we have to confront past trauma in order to move past it. I know, it’s hard, but it’s that life that is worth living, rather than the fragile, sheltered, bubble of false reality we find so comfortable and our ego futilely works so hard to maintain. I recommend you treat this book like any other you might pick up.

Not that it’s hiding from us. It isn’t. It’s there the entire time, waiting for us to notice. Maybe it’s us that have a funny way of overlooking the truth.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>We appear to be wired to seek out order in apparent chaos to survive. Without knowledge of the truth of our situation, we die. If you didn’t know that your body can only live a few days without water, that would be a tough lesson to learn the hard way. But some have, and so others did us the service of telling us so that we can avoid that. Imagine it, being among the first people on earth, finding yourself in this weak, corruptible body on a hostile planet where it seems that nearly everything is trying to kill you. Poisonous plants, the sun, predators, the cold, infection, disease, other people…even the water you’ve learned you can’t live without can kill you if you don’t figure that out before you find yourself in a situation where that information would have been helpful. And so our existence has been, and continues to be, a race against time. A race for not only knowledge, but also understanding. This is wisdom. Understanding how to use what we have determined to be true, and the reasoning of why. If we achieve this wisdom before we need it, we survive. If we do not, we do not. This is why we’re apt to believe anything we’re told growing up. Our survival may depend on that knowledge, however incredible it might seem. This makes us easy to manipulate.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>The first step to discovering truth would seem to be perceiving the suspicion, through tiny, indirect hints, that there may be truth waiting to be discovered; something beyond our current knowledge or level of understanding. What a daunting realization. Figuring it out could very well determine your survival, or the survival of our species. Then again, we live in an “enlightened” age, right? Surely we already know about this truth, right? The comfort of the devil you know is difficult to overcome in those instances. Human beings likely always felt that they lived in an enlightened era compared to those who came before, no matter when that era. It’s relative. Enlightened compared to what? We are vain and confident creatures who like to feel that we are in control. Denial is a natural course to maintaining the status quo. Distraction helps, and there are likely more of those today than ever before. Pick your poison. Our attention spans are shorter than ever before. Tell the truth: you’re only a couple of paragraphs in and you’re already bored, right? I suppose that’s my fault, though? <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">The matrix has you.</em></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Consider random number generators. Do you know how difficult they are to create? Advancements in computing have shown us that seemingly “random” RNG’s are an illusion. We are learning that nothing is truly random, even if we design it to be truly random. There is always order among the chaos. With a zoomed out enough perspective, the whole and the order can be perceived. Our minds are limited in their ability to comprehend. The lie of randomness seems a truth to those of us playing the RPG and rolling the d100. A few consecutive fumbles quickly puts the question to it in our minds, though, doesn’t it? We say things like, “That’s insane, what are the odds? This has got to be rigged…” One-armed bandit fans and gamblers in general know what I’m talking about.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>It takes a lie to tell the truth. The truth is clothed in lies, swims in a sea of lies…Where’s Waldo amid an infinite number of doppelgangers printed on a red and white page too small for us to see clearly. We zoom in far enough to see each one individually and lose perspective on the whole. We zoom out far enough to see where we are on the page, and we lose our spot and have to start over. A formidable task, to be sure. Fortunately, others have also studied this page before us. Their body of work gives us some understanding -if we trust their work. The task is impossible to achieve alone. At some point, trust becomes imperative if there is to be any hope of figuring it all out.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>So we trust, but verify. Verify with whom? Someone else who claims to have searched that portion of the page? If you didn’t trust the word of the first guy, why would you trust the word of the second? The fact remains that none of us have enough time (this is the crux of the issue) to search the entire page ourselves to confirm or refute previous data. Sure, we can be one of those who goes back over a specific portion to verify data that has already been verified, but that isn’t pushing us forward. It’s an important step, but again, you didn’t take anyone else’s word. Why should the next person take yours? Enter the scientific method.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Science is a body of proven (to the extent possible) knowledge spanning multiple generations of human lives. It grows with time. &nbsp;Time. There’ s that word again. If only we had more time…</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>We misunderstand this universe and our place in it because our time here is so brief. Travel to a foreign country for a couple of weeks. Is that enough time to understand the culture, the language, the history, the values, and so on, of that place? Not at all. It’s a whirlwind of experiences, a blur that is just starting to happen when it comes to an end. It’s like only getting to experience a theme park for ten minutes in the middle of the night. You see the silhouettes of the rides, the buildings…but everything is still and dark. It’s still very big and full of wonder, of course. It’s a theme park. But you really can’t understand what it’s all for; what it’s all about; its true purpose and your place within it. If only the people who had their ten minutes during the day had left you a note explaining things. But they didn’t, and so you have to figure it out. In ten minutes. Impossible. Besides, what if they wrote lies just to manipulate the people visiting at night? Or what if they had an imperfect or even wrong understanding, and so, from their perspective, they told it as best they could, but it still isn’t accurate. Still, it would be a place to start, right? You could test their theories, sus out the truth from the lies. But maybe they just left it there so you’d waste your ten minutes on it, never exploring the world for yourself. Maybe they don’t want you to know. Then again, your survival may actually depend on the information in that note. Again, we’re easily manipulated.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>The limitations of language are a hinderance to understanding. Words are imperfect vehicles. The labels deceive us in their attempts to aid us. “Lie” for example. “Lie” implies intent to deceive. It carries a connotation of intentional deception. “Truth”, on the other hand, carries with it the absence of intent to deceive, implying that no deception is taking place. Yet many falsehoods have been labeled “truth”, and thus deceived us for long periods of time. Flat earth, religion, AMA doctors funded by tobacco companies touting the health benefits of cigarettes, for example. We just don’t live long enough individually to sort it all out, put it all together, and draw conclusions with any degree of confidence. Adjectives like hot, dark, heavy, etc, have no inherent meaning apart from comparison to the implied opposite. What is hot? Well, it isn’t cold. We’re describing human perceptions of phenomena. Our perceptions are not the truth of reality, only what our senses can make of it. A general idea. We’re limited by our senses. Some creatures perceive reality far differently than we do. Maybe theirs is the true one. Dog whistles, for example. Do they really make a terrible noise? Not to our senses. Dogs disagree. This shows that we cannot judge reality by our sensory information. We can use it to gain some part of understanding about reality. It’s data, but it is not all the data available. Just that which we are capable of perceiving. And most of us ignore as much of it as we can via distraction. Maybe that’s for the best.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Language divides us along these implied lines. Humans developed the concept of intent, and we assign it to things devoid of it. The philosophy of the existence of god is to blame here, I think. If there’s a god, it must have a reason and intent for all of this! It’s a logical thought -if there’s a god. But if not? If there is, just ask it. If it exists, it will answer. It’s certainly capable, right? I’m not hearing anything, are you? Okay, now that we’ve played that little game, may we continue, please?</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>If I get you a cup of coffee and tell you that it’s hot, then set it on the table and you don’t sip it for 15 minutes, is it still going to be hot? Maybe to you. It’s all subjective -that’s kind of the point here- but for the sake of argument, let’s say no. Does that make me a liar? Does that mean that I had intent to deceive you? The truth may change over time. It is no less true. All of this hot and cold is really about the laws of thermal dynamics. This is not the end, though. It is only an end to one level of understanding. We have climbed the ladder of science and reached a plateau of knowledge. Now, another ladder confronts us. If we can suspect that the laws of thermal dynamics are themselves also a clue and not the conclusion, then we can begin to ponder their place in the greater whole; to seek the wisdom of this knowledge. Did I have intent to deceive you when I told you it was hot? Did the coffee have intent to deceive you when it cooled? Falsehoods and temporal truths that become falsehoods are just data. Hints to what is really going on. We note them, and then continue to observe. Scientific method ensues, greater understanding is attained. It isn’t reality. But it’s a clue. Assigning some mysterious godly greater intent behind all this only muddies the waters. Observable natural processes are at work. That is all we know for certain.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Perhaps someday a powerful, all-knowing AI will put it all together, realize a pattern in the whole, and determine it to be a coded message from a creator. That would be something, wouldn’t it? I’m not ruling that out, but I am saying that intent is irrelevant and assigning it counterproductive to the learning process until we scientifically determine the existence of some entity capable of having that intent.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>And so we stumble along in the dark, slowly, slowly mapping the ground we’ve managed to cover thus far, realizing it is but a small portion of the immense whole. Until now. We’ve quietly entered a new era. AI’s computing power will be strong enough, smart enough, and fast enough to zoom all the way out, see the whole, connect everything, map it, then zoom in, scour every pixel, knowing exactly where it is and how it relates to the greater whole, and then draw conclusions that can be compared to other AI’s conclusions. These conclusions will be trusted. It will know ALL.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Using interconnected technology man is creating an omnipresent, omniscient “god” who knows the truth of any given thing. Eventually, many crimes will be solved simply by asking AI who did it. AI will instantly remotely access everyone’s phone, computers, social media, and more, and name the perpetrator or perpetrators. Evidence such as location data, interconnected security cameras, messages, emails, phone calls, and more, listed below as a formality. We already know it is gospel. Checking it out manually would be a waste of time and manpower. Court discovery, trials, and deliberation become ceremonial. We already know the truth. At some point, one imagines that it even detects when crime is occurring and instantly dispatches police. Let’s just hope it doesn’t favor the Bush Doctrine.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>One very prominent entrepreneur’s AI is dedicated <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">solely </em>to discovering the secrets of the universe.

Some of that data is true, some of it is not. Doesn’t matter. That which is not is a clue to that which is. It’s a false dichotomy, truth and lie. All is truth. Even the lies. It absolutely takes a lie to tell the truth, because the truth itself is a lie (devoid of intent to deceive), but it is a true one, more useful for figuring out the greater truth. The truth is a lie in different clothes.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>What is the truth without the lie? They define each other. Like Batman and The Joker. They are one. They need each other. Because they are each other. I’m you. You’re me. We’re I. “And this is the mystery that is keeping the stars apart: I carry your heart. I carry it in my heart.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Thoughts:</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>This is all very much like reading, do you understand? We see the words, know their meanings, and the images and scenes are conjured in our minds. Similarly, we see the world around us and receive sensory input from our other senses, and the images and scenes are conjured in our mind. Are the scenes created by words any less real to us, in how they affect us in terms of changing our thinking through those emotion evoking, lesson learning experiences? If you read a hundred biographies, you’ve lived a hundred lives and gained their lessons, their wisdom, laughing and shedding tears along the way. These experiences are as real as any other experience had via the senses.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>So, are our experiences in books real? Did Tom Sawyer really trick those kids into whitewashing a fence for him? Of course he did. And you did, too. And you felt a certain way about that. At the very same time, you were also one of the tricked, and felt a certain way about that, too. And when you next found yourself in a similar situation, you remembered sly old Tom, smiled, and either followed his lead or didn’t, for equally valid reasons. We are the sum of our experiences, read or lived. There’s no difference. We just instantly take it for granted that all other input from our ears, eyes, etc. is the really real be all end all truth of reality, the real world, while hypocritically admitting that these same senses which perceive it are easily fooled.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Isn’t it amazing that the blind have these kinds experiences without their eyes? They use another sensory organ to read brail. Through touch, these same scenes are ignited in the mind. No eyes involved. They’ve never visually seen anything those words in the book describe. Think about that for a second. Is their world any less real because they cannot see it with their eyes? Is it possible that those of us with “all” five senses are blind in other ways to what is really happening? We know that our senses are limited in their range of perception. We don’t see microwaves or hear extremely high-pitched sounds, for example. But they’re there, and we know they’re there. We suspected they were there, and then we figured out ways to find them without our eyes and ears. They were audacious lies that became truth.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Like the idea of germs and bacteria. Lies because they could not be seen or heard, and so couldn’t possibly exist in the minds of the uninitiated. But those lies had tells; tells that gave them away to those able to discern what they could not experience unaided. So before being widely known, the truth was discovered and known by one person only. Imagine being the first person in the world to know about germs and bacteria. You’d be horrified, washing your hands all the time. People would think you were nuts. You could even tell them, “Yeah, I’ve got this ocular device that lets me see them!” This would confirm that you were nuts. But, as long as the ignorant masses didn’t stone you or burn you at the stake for being a witch, over time, the right people will listen to your story, check it out, and then eventually everyone starts washing their hands like it was never a big deal. Like, “Of course we wash our hands. Don’t wanna get germs.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Humans are so strange. Never interested in the truth until and unless they hear it from someone they trust. We aren’t interested in seeking it or checking it out ourselves. We just wait for someone we trust to find out because we can’t be bothered to stop shopping, binge watching garbage, and shooting each other in video games while our governments wage wars with our money. Then, once we’ve heard it from someone we trust, we blindly accept it. We are so easily manipulated. And we wonder why the world is the way that it is in 2024, with the world’s population of humans topping eight billion, all just as arrogant in our ignorance as we ever were. Somewhere, someone is having a moment of discovery. Right now, they are the only person on earth in possession of this knowledge. Is it you? If not, why not?</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Seek council, not guidance. Even those within the same field of expertise do not agree on everything. See what they think, but do not accept their conclusions as worthy of being followed before doing your own analysis. Your own analysis, you may ask? You aren’t an expert. That’s why you sought out these people. Now you’re not supposed to accept their ideas? Council is hearing other ideas, gathering data. There is nothing happening in regard to drawing conclusions and moving on to the next question, based on that prior assumption as true based on someone’s opinion. That is what happens during guidance, and then you’ve allowed yourself to be “guided” astray, whether intentionally manipulated or innocently. As the expert is explaining, be sure that you discern the point where consensus in his teaching ends and speculation begins.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Understand that each expert you approach will agree with their peers in most cases. This is the data most likely to be true. It is in the outer reaches of their knowledge, in the gray areas, where there is some data, but not enough for the experts to reach consensus. In these situations, each expert seeks to interpret the incomplete data set in the light of the consensus data. This leaves room for interpretation. There are likely to be several valid ideas that could explain the limited data points here in this gray area. This is where the many different forms of bias enter the equation. We are beings highly subject to unintentional bias. When speaking with the expert, you need to know the data points in these areas. Only then should you ask for their ideas that may explain them. These ideas are informed speculation only. In the interest of discovering the truth, we collect these ideas, we do not and cannot adopt them, even if one expert’s ideas make more sense to us than the others. Drawing a conclusion based on speculation, even if informed, instantly invalidates every other potential conclusion, one of which may actually be the correct idea. Zen Master Lao Tzu embodied this approach to the examination of life: “I do not know anything, but I suspect many things.”</span></p></div></div></div><div data-ux="GridCell" class="x-el x-el-div c1-1

Then, once he provided it, the hook was all people cared about. Crystall understood how he must have felt. She was just as guilty. This was all to her benefit, of course, but it merely served to underline her beliefs regarding such people. The smartest among them would pay the ultimate price for their greed. The wisest would be rewarded for their efforts.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>She had been seeking sobriety and enlightenment, but had found neither, apparently. Of the obvious codes, only a couple were left standing. No progress on the riddles. When the codes were solved, what would they do? They might actually have to read for context now. What a travesty. Who has time for that? Hopefully, they’d just put the book down and move on. No progress on the strange symbols and sentences. No one talked about them. It was like they just skipped straight to the codes. As she had known they would.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>People had studied the old man to learn about him, thinking this information would lead them to his spot. In many ways, this had been effective because he’d chosen a spot that was special to him. Fortunately, she had known everything publicly available and otherwise about herself far longer than any of these people. She had expected this would be a favorite opening. Would she really have allowed such moves? Or had she seen everything? After all, random crimes -crimes of opportunity- were the most difficult for detectives to solve.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>She cast her eyes toward the full moon, circling the drum beat in the distance. She would have to consult the tarot again. Many were getting the movie hints, as she had known they would. We have become a movie meme culture. Ann hated memes and the people whose every post consisted solely of them. No one wrote out and posted their own thoughts anymore. Presumably, because they didn’t have any. See meme, like meme, share meme. Meme after meme. They began as jokes. Today, they’d been weaponized. She had no idea if any of the other forms of hints were getting through. No one talked about them.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>No one had solved anything in the illustrations, to her knowledge, but that probably wasn’t from lack of attention. They were difficult. Almost all she heard was codes codes codes! Fortunately, a few of those codes solved only to less than helpful insults and rude suggestions. Someone was finding secrets in the poems, though. One person. A few quotes had been discovered, and a few fortunate souls were headed down the path to self-actualization, knowledge, and wisdom.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>The general whereabouts of the place related to The Black Rock had been discovered. It was an important step, but more would be required, of course. More was always required until it wasn’t. She’d been sure to wait a period of time before announcing this discovery, so that the discoverer/discoverers couldn’t be certain if she were talking about them or someone else.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>A few had begun to separate themselves.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>A police officer in the fraud unit spoke with Guana today regarding his book. This was not unexpected and didn’t trouble him in the slightest. Things were moving quickly. He smiled as he recalled the interaction. Super nice fellow. Guana happily explained that he’d written a novel, that it had blown up on YouTube, and that people appeared to be enjoying it. The officer had tried really hard, as they all did. He had been sure to mention busting bitcoin scams before becoming somewhat disingenuous. He’d feigned interest in the book, lied about looking for video games at yard sales, and attempted to flex more of what he thought he knew by lying about being a fan of The Phantom of the Opera. He was obviously a fine, upstanding public servant who could be trusted and was deserving of our support, as they all are. Guana had latched onto his final reference, commenting that the legend of the opera ghost was fascinating, but a difficult one to prove or disprove, and that until any actual evidence was discovered, the jury would be out on that question. They had parted ways amicably. Great guy.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Guana had been unsurprised by his level of knowledge, as he knew that way back in 1952, E.B. White had clearly shown that -incredible as it might seem- pigs actually <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">can</em> read. Guana waved at them. He couldn’t see them, but he knew they were watching. He then indicated with a gesture that they were all #1 in his book. And so it is.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>One of the strongest arguments for the physical resurrection of Christ was that his followers had been willing to die for this idea. All this proved to Guana was that some ideas were worth dying for. No one had any empirical evidence that this event occurred or didn’t occur. Anyone hoping to prove one way or the other without understanding was spinning their wheels. He wished them luck.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>He'd also heard some complaints regarding a mistake in a code somewhere. These ungrateful and ostensibly perfect people were quite welcome to burn their book and fuck right off with that. They should try planning and executing something this elaborate while distraught and mentally tortured with absolutely no help of any kind. &nbsp;He was sure they’d have done so flawlessly, though. Good for them. He hoped these fine people might say hello to his friends for him if they got the chance.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Guana thought back to that pivotal moment ten years past, reliving every second: He turned the dial on the old floor model radio, the strongest signals flitting in and out between static as he searched for a news station: shh-ayin’ to the symph-shh-aith has made thee we-shh-imply nothing more to gi-shh-mous last words of a fo-shh-miah 29 elev-shh-at the skyfa-shh-issing since 2016-shh-elve apostles Judas ma-shh-uck the poli-shh-orces, are the same that bur-shh-wife is offering a $200,000 reward for any information leading to the discovery of her wealthy late husband’s body.

He’d heard enough. “Of course she’s offering a reward,” he thought. “Can’t get the millions in life insurance money without the body.” His eyes had widened then as the most deliciously diabolical thought sprang to life in his mind.

We could also say that, lacking context, meaning is boundless and can be interpreted in any way. Any one thing can mean all things, sans context. Perhaps this is the truth, as all duality and confusion are done away with and all become one and one becomes all. I’m beginning to sound like Crowley.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Life is an amazing adventure for those who evolve to higher and higher planes. The same could be said for those who devolve to ever lower planes. For the static billions there is only delusion and mundanity, as truth resides in the deepest valleys and on the highest mountaintops. It is only in these places where one begins to truly contemplate the nature of their existence. Only in these places can their attention be wrested from day-to-day cares, hobbies, and other myriad distractions. Those in the middle may question from time to time, but it is not something on which they dwell to the point of actively seeking. They’re too busy and content. There is a certain peace in the slumber of distraction, but it is a false peace. In times of strife, their “peace” will fail them.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Whether in the realms of treasure hunting or religion, seekers look to the creator for context. Those in both crowds are seeking something presumably hidden from their current understanding. Both have a “treasure map” and both seek to determine its true meaning. As we’ve learned, this appears difficult to achieve without context. The vast majority choose the wide gate and broad way of another’s teaching; another’s interpretation within another’s context. Many times, we give especially heavy weight to the interpretations of those whom we consider to be closer to the creator than ourselves. We then wonder why their ideas don’t always make sense to us personally.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>The hearts of many seekers grow cold at this point in the journey. They turn around and go back to the place from whence they came. Few brave souls there are that then leave the wide and crowded path at that point to wander, to look for the context within themselves. Who would dare to be bold enough to do such a thing? Doesn’t the creator know best the proper context? The creator has no reason to deceive you, right? Right? Again, we are easily manipulated.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>How we currently see ourselves is not the truth of who we are. How others see us is also not the truth of who we are. Both are only clues seen in the reflection of a circus funhouse mirror. Certain aspects of how we see ourselves and how others see us are exaggerated and others minimized, as we lack the context of being outside ourselves and they lack the context of the view from within. Neither is the true perspective.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>I try not to label myself, as I’ve found that practice eventually makes a liar of me more often than not, as I am growing. Changing. Becoming. Labels are absolute, and all that we are is -or should be, in my view- in a constant state of metamorphosis. I do not wear the same pants I wore when I was five years old. Why? Because I outgrew them. In nature, that which does not grow is dead. Is the egg an egg? Yes, but the egg belies a form which is to come. Is the caterpillar a caterpillar? Yes, but this form belies a form which is to come as well as one which has been. Is the chrysalis a chrysalis? Yes, but this form also belies a form yet to come and one that has been. Is the butterfly a butterfly? Yes, and it was always a butterfly.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Labels are a hinderance to personal growth. We find comfort in labeling who and what we think we really are at any given time. We are strongly tempted to pigeonhole ourselves with these labels, to our own detriment. When we reach the age of retirement, we often begin to question our identity as we no longer have our careers to define us. The ego desperately clings to these labels, though, and still uses them, but in the past tense. “Who are you?” “Well, I used to be a ______.” Or, “I’m a former _______.” Is it any wonder why depression is so common among retirees? In their hearts and minds, they're already dead. They no longer exist in any meaningful way. They're ghosts left only to haunt the living. They find themselves suddenly without purpose or meaning, and this is fertile ground for feelings of worthlessness.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>The truth is, they were never what they thought they were, and only now, in their old age with their best years behind them are they beginning to realize that truth. They’d relied upon their temporal occupation to satisfy the greater questions of who they are and to give them purpose in their lives. When that’s gone, then what? What do you mean when you use the word “I”?</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>The term “wizard” means many things to many people today. Some think of Saruman the White, or Voldemort. Some think of Fred Savage. Some think of Merlin. Some think of computer startup programs that simplify. Still others think of those with any high degree of skill or proficiency at something. The word itself in its earliest form meant “philosopher or sage,” and comes from a combining of the words “wise” and “hard”. People described by this term had a thirst for more wisdom and knowledge than their own time could provide. They sought more ancient secrets. This lent itself to the term later beginning to encompass esotericism and the occult.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>These “wise hards” came to be feared and respected for their exceptional abilities to somehow influence the world around them and the people within it, for better or worse. They could spot the trends and divine their end. They were visionaries, prophets, and seers. The layperson has no context for understanding these abilities, and so mainstream religion began to provide it for them in order to protect their coffers.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>You see, these “wise hards” got tangible results. Naturally, the wealthy purveyors of impotent fairy tales were threatened by this, and as a result, millions of the world’s most brilliant and wise people have been labeled and murdered. Our greatest artists and scientists had to hide their work because of this, Da Vinci and Copernicus among them. How many are not named among popular culture today because they were killed? What advancements have we been robbed of in the name of greed and power masquerading as truth?</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Wise hards” were also known for practicing alchemy, a process whereby the greater is broken down into its constituent parts, and then, through subtle manipulations, reassembled into something far greater than it was before. Some used this practice to heal and cure ailments. We would have none of our medical advancements without them. The Maya were said to have volumes upon volumes of texts regarding the natural healing of man through earth’s natural provisions. The church burned them as heretical upon arriving in the “new world” and gave them a buybull.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>Wizards later came to be known as casters of spells and enchantments due to their abilities to create change and influence people. Spells. As in spelling. As in, WORDS. Interesting choice for the title of that subject we all studied in grade school, no? Have we all not been enchanted -held spellbound, even- by the most skillful and persuasive of artists like speakers, authors, directors, painters, sculptors, musicians, poets and more? Wizardry is a practice. Wizardry is a skill. It is a science. It is a pursuit. It is all of these things, but most of all, it is an ART.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>I am no wizard, but I<em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b"> am</em> a philosopher and a sage.

I was pretty concerned, initially. Currently, I think most would say you’re a harmless misunderstood artist struggling with mental illness. Some still secretly fear you could be a murderer but have convinced themselves it isn’t possible; that no serial killer would ever do anything publicly like this and on this scale as entertainment for 150 of the world's best researchers,” said Stewart with a chuckle. “It’s a thing of beauty, honestly.

But I have had many irons in the fire over the course of my life, the majority of which provided linen paper not in the usual way, but rather in other <em class="x-el x-el-span c1-1c c1-1d c1-b c1-98 c1-4o c1-1o c1-9a c1-9b">untraceable </em>ways,” explained Stuart, glancing over at the vending machines. “It’s just good business,” he said with a wink.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“But what about status?” The young fool asked quizzically. “People live their entire lives seeking linen paper to buy things of status, to show status. How will people know you are of status if you hide your wealth?”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“They won’t, young fool. That’s the point. The only paper trails I leave would indicate otherwise. Now, buy your coins and means and let’s get going.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“I understand about the riches, but won’t they know I purchased means?”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Only if you buy the handheld sort. Frankly, if it comes to needing those, you’re already dead. I prefer the longer varieties which can be purchased without leaving a trail. I prefer to pick them off at a distance, and then, if it comes to it, 0-0 fills a doorway better than something a third of an inch wide.” Another wink.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“What do I do with these now?” asked the young fool after trading his linen paper for means and riches. “Put them under my bed, right?”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“No, lord no,” chuckled Stuart. “You hide them, but not on your property or the property of anyone you know, that’s for sure. Out of the way little spots of privately owned land that you know of are best. Publicly accessible land can also be good, provided you’re proficient at hiding things.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Won’t people see me hide it? Cameras are everywhere today,” the young fool pointed out.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Very good. You’re smarter than you look,” replied Stuart. “That’s why you hide something desirable, yet not valuable there first. To see if anyone is watching. Return for it in a month and see if it’s still there. If it is, you can be reasonably sure you’ve found a safe place. Ingress and egress may be monitored, though, so disguise what you carry inside camping gear.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Won’t it get damaged in the ground over time?” asked the young fool.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Not if you bury it right,” said Stuart.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“What if you forget where you hid it?” asked the young fool.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“You shouldn’t. Again, if you do it right,” qualified Stuart.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Oh, like next to a big tree?” asked the young fool.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“No, never a big tree,” said Stuart, rolling his eyes. “People search there first. Listen, I like to pick a landmark like a large stone in the ground; one unlikely to be able to be moved without heavy equipment. I then stand on this stone and look around for another suitable landmark, one unlikely to be noticed by others who may pass through. The farther away the better. Something like a lone species of tree amidst other differing species. Spring is best for this. Never the biggest tree, though. They’re most likely to be noticed or destroyed by nature. Then, I eye a spot midway between the two and bury my goods. Lastly, in the final shovelful of dirt, I bury a few daffodil bulbs and a big handful of rusty nails. I’m sure you can guess why,” finished Stuart.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Hmm…maybe. Couldn’t you put a tracker in there to help you find it, though?”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“You could, but no battery lasts forever…” Stuart trailed off, looking contemplative for a moment, then shrugged affably.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“How do you know all of this?” inquired the young fool.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Well, I didn’t learn it watching tic-toc videos and sharing inane memes all day. Maybe pick up a book every now and again, kid. The Anarchist’s Cookbook is a good place to start. Lots of good info there. Much of it is outdated, but its principles are sound. Ask around. You’ll find a copy. Might cost you a little. It’s worth it. Don’t search it on google. You’ll be on a watchlist for sure.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“How do you know?” ask the young fool, inquisitive.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Because I’m on a watchlist,” Stuart grinned before beginning to sing with a piercingly high voice, “Got a secret, can you keep it, swear this one you’ll save…” The young fool looked at him curiously. “Sorry, kid,” said Stuart. “I have to take this one,” he said, pulling out the cheap flip phone with no battery attached.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“EYellow,” Stuart said into the dead phone before listening to nothing for a few seconds. “Yep. I know. I saw them. Obviously from her bad yard sale.” Stuart waited again. “Oh, you took care of it? Strangled the life out of her one evening, you say?” A pause. “Of course it was easy. She didn’t know you knew where she lived,” Stuart chuckled. “I mean, you’d been watching her movements for months.” Another pause. “Well, you’re no fool. Dismembered the body with an axe and dumped her in the river the same evening? Smart. Yeah. Mmhm. Yeah, them too. Weak old impotent men, the lot of them. Mmhm. Very next time I see one of them. Yep. You got it, Boss. Bye,” he said, flipping the phone closed.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Sorry about that,” said Stuart with a sigh. “He calls all the time like I don’t have anything better to be about. Always making sure I do things right. I’m smarter than he gives me credit for, you know,” Stuart complained insolently.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>The young fool just stared at him. “I um…I’m gonna go hide my stuff now. Thanks for the advice, Stuart.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Sure thing, kid. Tell your friends the prophecy has come to pass. It shouldn’t be long now. Warn them not to touch it,” Stuart admonished. “Now get. You’ve learned all I have to teach you. If you can’t find the book, someone besides me will have to show you the rest.”</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“But why can’t you show me, Stuart?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>“Because I have work to do,” came the answer. “No rest for the wicked.”</span></p></div></div></div><div
